## Next Admin

Full-stack web application built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs), a popular React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and static website generation.
The application is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs), a platform known for its efficient deployment of JavaScript applications.

# About the project

The application is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types and other powerful features to the language. This ensures a more robust codebase and helps catch errors early in the development process.

[EsLint](https://eslint.org/) is used for linting the codebase, enforcing coding standards, and catching potential bugs, making the code more consistent and maintainable.

The application uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as its database, a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used to manage relationships between data, provide schema validation, and translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

For styling, the application uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable designs and rapid UI development.

Authentication is implemented using [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), a complete authentication and user management platform.
